## Future Plans

- Add a feature that helps you setup Maven easily for lazy people. (changing variables and paths, even downloading the project.)
- Make custom resolutions in the settings menu.
- Revamp all major main menu's and deprecate the use of the Menu Book, and convert them all into one central menu.
- Make features externally added, rather than hard set in the main script. (This will mean you can choose which features are in the main script)
