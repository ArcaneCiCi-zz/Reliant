Reliant 1.10 (The Return)

- Removed the Launcher
- Added an Auto Updater, no more manually downloading updates!
- Made Reliant depend only on itself, when you start it up for the first time, it will generate the default settings files, and download updates.
- Reliant will automatically repair files that have been removed.
- Rewrote part of the menu selector code, and fixed coloring bugs in them.

NOTE: Reliant now stores settings in the "settings" folder, if you need to transfer settings over, drag them from the "logs" folder to the "settings" folder.
